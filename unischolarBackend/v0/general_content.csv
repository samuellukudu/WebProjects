[3]. Ming Huang's Annual China Economy Lecture, taught me how to operate a country.
[4]. Integrity, an alumnus in jail share with us his real experience. 
[5]. My very last lesson in Cornell: alumni graduated 10, 20, and 30 years gathered to share their real live journey.

Expect the extraordinary in the campus: your PE instructor might be an Olympic champion, or a billionare who recently sold his company to Google.

"#1 Best Colleges for Computer Science in KentuckyUniversity of KentuckyLexington, KY4 YearRating3.73out of 54,202 reviewsSenior:My time at the University of Kentucky has been an incredibly rewarding experience. One of the things I’ve appreciated most is the strong sense of community — both in and out of the classroom. The faculty are knowledgeable and approachable, and the resources available through Gatton College of Business and Economics have helped me grow academically and professionally. I’ve also had the chance to be involved in clubs like the Excel Financial Modeling Club and Gatton Líderes, which have connected me with peers who are just as driven.

What I’d like to see improve is more guidance and support for students looking for internships early on in their college career.

The coursework is rigorous yet practical, providing me with skills that are directly applicable to my field.

It is walking distance from downtown Morehead, one of my favorite aspects. The nursing building is a little bit further, so some people prefer to drive; the agriculture units are fully off-campus and do not have a shuttle to them, so you need your own transportation for that. Funding for non-STEM programs is rather tight right now, leading to cuts in those areas. Most professors, however, love what they do and are there to help students. Housing and food quality leave much to be desired between maintenance issues taking a long time to be repaired and food that doesn't always agree with you (depending somewhat on dining location and individual).

I appreciated the small class sizes in many departments, which made it easier to connect with faculty and peers.

I liked the wide variety of programs and student organizations available — there’s truly something for everyone. WKU also offers excellent support services like tutoring, mental health resources, and career counseling, which helped me stay on track.

However, I’d like to see improvements in areas such as parking availability, communication from administration, and expanding internship opportunities for more majors. More focus on diversity and inclusion efforts would also be a great step forward.
