## üìä Quality Scoring

### Confidence Scoring
Universities are scored based on multiple factors:

- **Extraction Method**: Different methods have different base confidence levels
  - Structured Data: 0.95
  - NER: 0.7-0.9 (context-dependent)
  - Pattern Matching: 0.75-0.9 (pattern-dependent)
  - Link Analysis: 0.85
  - List Extraction: 0.85

- **Context Factors**: Educational context boosts confidence
- **Domain Quality**: .edu domains and official sites get higher scores
- **Name Structure**: Proper capitalization and length validation

### Quality Scoring
Quality scores (0.0-1.0) based on:

- **Length Score**: 15-80 characters preferred (0.3 max)
- **Word Count**: 2-6 words preferred (0.3 max)
- **Capitalization**: Proper noun structure (0.2 max)
- **University Indicators**: Presence of "university", "college", etc. (0.2 max)

### Verification
Universities can be marked as "verified" if they meet high standards:
- Confidence ‚â• 0.8
- Quality score ‚â• 0.7
- Consistent across multiple sources

## üåç International Support

### Supported Languages
- **English**: university, college, institute, school
- **French**: universit√©, √©cole, institut
- **German**: universit√§t, hochschule, institut
- **Spanish**: universidad, colegio, instituto
- **Italian**: universit√†, collegio, istituto
- **Portuguese**: universidade, col√©gio, instituto

### Cross-Language Query Expansion
The system automatically expands queries across languages:
```python
# English query expanded to include international variants
"university" ‚Üí ["university", "universit√©", "universidad", "universit√†", "universit√§t"]
```

## üîç Advanced Features

### Name Normalization
Sophisticated name cleaning and normalization:
```python
# Input: "1. Harvard University - Top Research Institution"
# Output: "Harvard University"

# Input: "MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology)"

# Best representative chosen based on:
# - Confidence score
# - Name completeness
# - Official URL availability
```

### Deduplication
Advanced deduplication across sources:

      3. Score: 0.823 | https://uniranks.com/norway-universities...
```

## üéØ Use Cases

### 1. University Directory Creation
Extract comprehensive university lists from multiple sources:
```python
crawler = EnhancedUniversityCrawler()
search_results = search_engine.search("universities in norway")
universities = crawler.discover_universities(search_results)

# Get clean, validated university names
for uni in universities.universities:
    if uni.is_verified:
        print(f"Verified: {uni.name} - {uni.official_url}")
```

### 2. Academic Content Analysis
Analyze web content for university mentions:
```python
extractor = UniversityNameExtractor()
universities = extractor.extract_university_names(soup, url)

# Filter by quality
high_quality = [u for u in universities if u.quality_score >= 0.8]
```

### 3. International University Research
Research universities across multiple countries:
```python
queries = [
    "universities in norway",
    "universities in germany", 
    "universities in canada"
]

all_universities = []
for query in queries:
    result = crawler.search_and_crawl(query)
    all_universities.extend(result.organizations)
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No universities found**: Check if content contains proper university indicators
2. **Low confidence scores**: Verify content quality and structure
3. **Missing international names**: Ensure proper encoding and pattern support
4. **Duplicates**: Check deduplication settings and normalization

### Debug Mode
Enable detailed logging:
```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```
