# Plan for Improving the Web Scraping Script

This document outlines the current limitations of the script in `main.py`, explains why each is important, and provides detailed suggestions for improvement.

---

## 1. No Advanced Company Validation --DONE

**Importance:**
- The script currently assumes that any external link with a non-generic anchor text is a valid company. This can result in false positives (e.g., links to partners, news articles, or unrelated sites).

**Improvements:**
- Implement company name/entity recognition using NLP (e.g., spaCy, NER models).
- Cross-reference extracted names/URLs with business directories (e.g., LinkedIn, Crunchbase, OpenCorporates).
- Add heuristics for common company suffixes ("Ltd", "Inc", "GmbH", etc.).
- Optionally, use APIs to validate if a URL belongs to a registered business.

---

## 2. No Parallelization (Sequential Scraping) --DONE

**Importance:**
- Scraping URLs one at a time is slow, especially for large result sets. This limits scalability and increases total runtime.

**Improvements:**
- Use Python's `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` or `asyncio` with `aiohttp` for concurrent requests.
- Ensure robots.txt and rate limiting are still respected per domain.
- Implement a queue system to manage and throttle requests.

---

## 3. Limited to Anchor Tags (`<a>`) Only --DONE

**Importance:**
- Some company names or links may appear in other elements (e.g., plain text, lists, or JavaScript-rendered content), leading to missed data.

**Improvements:**
- Expand extraction to include structured data (e.g., JSON-LD, microdata, Open Graph tags).
- Use additional parsing for company mentions in text (NLP-based extraction).
- Consider using Selenium or Playwright for JavaScript-heavy sites.

---

## 4. No Retry Logic for Failed Requests --DONE

**Importance:**
- Network issues, temporary server errors, or rate limits can cause requests to fail. Without retries, potentially valuable data is lost.

**Improvements:**
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for failed requests.
- Log failed URLs for later inspection or reprocessing.
- Optionally, use proxy rotation to avoid IP bans.

---

## 5. No Logging (Only Print Statements) --DONE

**Importance:**
- Print statements are not suitable for production or large-scale scraping. They do not provide persistent, structured, or searchable logs.

**Improvements:**
- Integrate Python's `logging` module for configurable log levels and output destinations.
- Log key events: start/end, errors, skipped URLs, and summary statistics.
- Optionally, log to a file or external service for monitoring.

---

## 6. No Configurability or CLI Interface --DONE

**Importance:**
- Hardcoded parameters (query, delays, file names) limit reusability and flexibility.

**Improvements:**
- Use `argparse` or `click` to provide a command-line interface.
- Allow users to specify queries, output files, delays, and other parameters via CLI arguments or a config file.

---

## 7. No Unit or Integration Tests

**Importance:**
- Lack of tests makes it hard to ensure correctness, maintainability, and safe refactoring.

**Improvements:**
- Add unit tests for core functions (search, extraction, validation).
- Use mock responses for HTTP requests in tests.
- Set up continuous integration (CI) for automated testing.

---

## 8. No Proxy or User-Agent Rotation --DONE

**Importance:**
- Using a single user-agent and IP can lead to blocks or bans from some websites.

**Improvements:**
- Implement user-agent rotation (randomize from a list of common user-agents).
- Add support for proxy rotation (using a pool of proxies).

---

## 9. No Handling of Internationalization/Localization --DONE

**Importance:**
- The script may encounter non-English pages or company names, which could be missed or misclassified.

**Improvements:**
- Detect page language and handle Unicode/encoding issues.
- Optionally, use translation APIs for non-English content.

---

## 10. No Data Enrichment or Post-Processing

**Importance:**
- The output is a raw list of company names and URLs, which may lack context or additional useful information.

**Improvements:**
- Enrich results with metadata (e.g., company description, location, industry) using external APIs.
- Add post-processing steps for deduplication, normalization, and validation.

# Next Steps
- Prioritize improvements based on project goals and available resources.
- Implement enhancements incrementally, testing each change.
- Document new features and usage instructions in the README.
